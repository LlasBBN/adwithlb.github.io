  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>Welcome to ADwithLB. By working with us or using this website, you agree to the following terms and conditions. These terms protect both you as the client and us as the service provider, and help maintain a professional and transparent relationship.</p>

  <h2>1. Services</h2>
  <p>ADwithLB provides digital marketing services including social media management, paid advertising, Google Maps optimization, and growth consulting. All services are custom-built for each client and may evolve with time.</p>

  <h2>2. Communication</h2>
  <p>All communication is handled directly by Llas Karem, the founder. No automated responses or intermediaries are used. Clients are expected to respond in a timely manner to avoid project delays.</p>

  <h2>3. Payments & Refunds</h2>
  <p>All projects require a one-time upfront payment before work begins. This upfront fee is <strong>non-refundable under any circumstances</strong>, including cancellation by the client. This ensures commitment and reserves our time and resources exclusively for your project.</p>

  <h2>4. Invoicing</h2>
  <p>Invoices are issued through a trusted partner business. Payment terms and conditions will be clearly outlined before a project begins.</p>

  <h2>5. Abandonment & Delay</h2>
  <p>If the client becomes unresponsive for 14+ days without prior notice, the project may be marked as abandoned and closed without refund. Timeline delays caused by the client are not the responsibility of ADwithLB.</p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All deliverables become the clientâ€™s property once full payment is received. Until then, all materials remain the property of ADwithLB.</p>

  <h2>7. Portfolio Rights</h2>
  <p>Unless stated otherwise in writing, ADwithLB retains the right to showcase completed work as part of its portfolio and for promotional purposes.</p>

  <h2>8. Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>All communication and shared materials are kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with third parties without written permission.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>While we commit to using best practices, we cannot guarantee specific results due to the nature of digital platforms. ADwithLB will not be held liable for outcomes affected by algorithm changes or third-party policy shifts.</p>

  <h2>10. Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>This agreement is governed by the laws of Greece. Any legal matters will be resolved under Greek jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>If you have questions, email <a href="mailto:llas.bbn@gmail.com">llas.bbn@gmail.com</a>.</p>
